//Approach we Used :

// in this hashMap has entry like [key = prefixSum & value = currentIndex]

// if we have two points A & B having n points placed and having sum = S 
// then we have two points A & C and having point B placed in b/w A & C , B/w A & B there are m points placed  having sum = S
// so , that means we have sum = 0 B/W points B & C 
// Sum(AC) = Sum(AB) + Sum(BC) => [ S = S + Sum(BC) ]=> [ Sum(BC) = 0 ]
